**Immersed in the Sounds of Space**

**WORKING:**

An image is analysed by converting it to greyscale and taking brightness values for the pixels. Pitch values are assigned to the pixels by sampling an audio file. These are then merged together to create an audio file for the image, which can then be played.

**HOW TO USE:**

1. Clone this repo to the machine.

2. Import all required python libraries from requirements.txt.

3. Run the 'spaceapps_challenge_with_gui.py' file for GUI interface.

4. If you want to run without GUI interface. Run 'spaceapps_challenge_without_gui.py'

5. A GUI window will open.

6. Here, choose an image you want to convert to audio.
   
7. Then select an audio file to enhance the audio pitch for the bright stars.

8. Press the 'Convert' and then press the 'Play Audio' button.

9. Wait for some time and the audio will play automatically after being generated.
