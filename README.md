# SPACEAPPS CHALLENGE
**Immersed in the Sounds of Space**

**WORKING:**
An image is analysed by converting it to greyscale and taking brightness values for the pixels. Pitch values are assigned to the pixels by sampling an audio file. These are then merged together to create an audio file for the image, which can then be played.

**HOW TO USE:**

Run the 'spaceapps_challenge_with_gui.py' file. 
A GUI window will open.
Here choose an image and an audio file.
Press the 'Convert' and then press the 'Play Audio' button.
Wait for some time and the audio will play automatically after being generated.
